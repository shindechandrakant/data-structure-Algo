I believe I deserve this scholarship opportunity because I am an innovative problem solver. Over the last two years as student council president, I helped re-organize my entire school library to better accommodate today’s students’ needs. I worked with the library staff to categorize books in a way that reflects current school subjects.  I will use the same leadership mindset to obtain my business degree with a focus in project management.

My ultimate goal is to work in construction management to increase efficiency in low-income housing development. With this scholarship and the need-based grants I have been awarded, I can complete my education and continue to solve problems within my community.
